# Friender
The goal of Friender is to create a simple friend-finding survey that would automatically match you with someone from its store of possible friends. I primarily used Node and Express.

# How to use:
Follow the Heroku Link and fill out the survey!

# Known Bugs
I did not add a validate checker for the survey, so there may be bugs if you don't fill out the numbers. Also, if you submit the survey with the same inputs more than once, you will definitely be your own best friend.
