# Friender
The goal of Friender is to create a simple friend-finding survey that would automatically match you with someone from its store of possible friends. I primarily used Node and Express.

# How to use:
Follow the Heroku Link and fill out the survey!

# TODO: - Add more dummy friends.
# TODO: - Make the results pop up into the modal.
# TODO: - Make a better readme.
# TODO: - Deploy to Heroku.
